# Salad-Maker
Game created for Programming Assessment

## Features
- Local single keyboard multiplayer
- Persistent highscore list
- Powerups

## Objective
Create salads in accordance with the customers' orders by selecting
matching ingredients and combining them on a black chopping board.
Then serve the customers before they leave the store

## Controls
### Player 1
Move with W, A, S, D

Pick up and place food with LEFT SHIFT

### Player 2
Move with Arrow Keys (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN)

Pick up and place food with RIGHT SHIFT

## Miscellaneous
If a player satisfies a customers' order within 30% on the customer's wait time,
the customer will spawn a powerup for the player that submitted the food. The
powerup does one of three thing: Increases player speed, increases time left for
that player, or adds points to the player's score

If a player gives a customer the wrong food, that customer will become angry with
the player, which decreases the time that the customer will stay and causes the
penalty for the customer leaving to double for the player(s) who made the customer
angry
