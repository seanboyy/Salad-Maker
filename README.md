##Miscellaneous
If a player satisfies a customers' order within 30% on the customer's wait time,
the customer will spawn a powerup for the player that submitted the food. The
powerup does one of three thing: Increases player speed, increases time left for
that player, or adds points to the player's score

If a player gives a customer the wrong food, that customer will become angry with
the player, which decreases the time that the customer will stay and causes the
penalty for the customer leaving to double for the player(s) who made the customer
angry
